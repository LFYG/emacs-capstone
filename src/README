In case you want to port to a different release of capstone, included is a patch
for the const generator that adds elisp constants generation support. The
capstone const generator lives in capstone-version/bindings/const_generator.py.
Note that you will also have to mkdir the `elisp' directory in bindings/ before
you run the patched version of the script. Normally you shouldn't have to touch
this.
